How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
 was introduced?

    

Because it was working before and not after , that means the error was introduced by what is added or removed from the original

diff shows that what was added or removed.

The bug is the the diferences , things could be removed added or changed.

The tool does just that compare differences.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

Help to better understand the code.

Helps to better unestand what part of the code do what. 



---------------

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

git log shows a list of commit messages in the chronological order that happen (lifo)

git diff is used to compare two particular commits and see the specific code diferences


How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

Because by using version control one can go back to any previous commit that means all previous versions
of a file are save. So making a change is always reversible
