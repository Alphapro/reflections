When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you need to collaborate in a project with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because many people could me changing the remote repository and it could be difficult
    to follow what changes were made and the state of the source code

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    The 3 concepts have to do with copying. A branch is a copy on the same repository locally.
    A clone is a copy of an entire local or remote repository. A fork is a copy of an entire 
    repository done remotly (On github)   

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?
